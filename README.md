# Discord-Geffy
This repository contains all the code that Geffy, my Discord bot, uses. Geffy was initially an IRC bot that has been ported over.

# Commands
~givecookie <user name>: Gives a virtual cookie to a specific user in a channel.

~rate <noun>: Rates whatever item you provide on a scale of 0 to 5.

~tweet <message>: Allows you to send a tweet to Twitter straight from Discord. Run the command ~tweet first, and Geffy will send you a DM asking you to authenticate yourself through Twitter's API. Once you have done so, you may post a tweet by simply using the command ~tweet <message>. Any images that are attached to the Discord message that you post will also be included in the tweet. Once Geffy posts the tweet, users may retweet and favorite said tweet by using the :repeat: and :heart: emojis.
